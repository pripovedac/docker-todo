# Todo app

Simple **dockerized** todo app.

This is my first application using **Docker**, so don't expect anything special. Just exercising creating applications based on multiple containers. 
Also, my stronger suite is working on the frontend side. Bear that in mind when inspecting the `server` code.

But, gotta admit I do feel kinda proud of this little guy here. :)
